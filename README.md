## How does it work?
Once the application is run, the list of crypto and the relative values of each will be shown. The user has the possibility to update the data by scrolling down.
<br />
Crypto data is taken from this API: [Alphavantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/). In order to try this app you must first create your own key on the [site](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).
